# Data Analyst Portfolio Projects

This repository will hold all of the projects (code and queries) that are relevant to data analysis.

These projects are the product of personal effort, combined with the study and monitoring of relevant educational material. 

Please feel free to take these and run with them. Make them your own and find you own insights

If there are any relevant questions, I am available to answer them.
