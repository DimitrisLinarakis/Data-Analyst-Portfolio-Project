# Data Analyst Portfolio Projects

This repository will hold all of the projects (code and queries) that are relevant to data analysis.

These projects are the product of personal effort, combined with the study and monitoring of relevant educational material. 

Please feel free to take these and run with them. Make them your own and find you own insights

If there are any relevant questions, I am available to answer them.


## Project 1: Sales Analysis for Value Inc
Value Inc is a retail store that sells household items all over the world by bulk. 
The Sales Manager has no sales reporting but he has a brief idea of current sales.
He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit and top selling products. He wants a 
dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an excel sheet
